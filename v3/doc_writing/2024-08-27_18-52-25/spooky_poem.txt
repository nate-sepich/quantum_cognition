Poem:

In a house where darkness dwells,
Whispers echo in hidden cells.
Shadows dance in the moonlit room,
A chilling presence, impending doom.

Footsteps creak on the stair,
A figure emerges, a cloak of despair.
Eyes gleaming with a ghostly light,
Haunting the halls in the dead of night.

Fear grips the heart, a silent scream,
Lost in a nightmare, a waking dream.
The truth revealed, a ghastly sight,
In the haunted house, where day meets night.

Whispers fade, shadows flee,
The house stands silent, but who holds the key?
A twist of fate, a tale untold,
In the haunted house, where mysteries unfold.
