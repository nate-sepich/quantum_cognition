In the dead of night, where shadows creep,
Whispers echo, secrets keep,
A ghostly figure, pale and stark,
Haunts the woods, in the dark.

Footsteps silent, yet I hear,
Heartbeat racing, filled with fear,
Eyes that glow in the gloom,
A presence that spells impending doom.

Closer it creeps, without a sound,
My breath held tight, on haunted ground,
A shiver runs down my spine,
In the moon's eerie shine.

A chilling touch, a phantom's graze,
In this haunted, spectral maze,
The unknown beckons, a ghostly call,
As night's shadows start to fall.

And as the night reaches its height,
In the darkness, I face my plight,
For in this realm of fear and dread,
I am lost, with the spirits, I tread.

The ghostly figure fades away,
Leaving me in disarray,
But its presence lingers on,
In the night, until the dawn.
