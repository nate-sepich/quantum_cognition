"""
This script contains a process for document writing using the langchain_core library. It has been successfully tested on the author's machine and is intended to be the starting point for a project that utilizes pydantic models for better component interfacing and scalability.
The script includes the following functionalities:
- Writing and saving a text document
- Editing a document by inserting text at specific line numbers
- Reading a specified document
- Creating and saving an outline
- Executing Python code and displaying the output
- Creating a function-calling agent and adding it to the graph
- Creating a supervisor agent to manage conversations between workers
- Creating a state graph to orchestrate the document writing process
The script is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the creation of custom agents and easy integration with the langchain_core library.
Note: The script is a result of a previous interaction with an AI programming assistant and utilizes the langchain_core library. It is recommended to have a good understanding of the langchain_core library and its functionalities before modifying or extending the script.
