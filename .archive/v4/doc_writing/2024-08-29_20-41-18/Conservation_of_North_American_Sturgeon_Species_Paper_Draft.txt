## Conclusion

The conservation of North American sturgeon species is a complex and pressing issue that requires immediate and sustained attention. Throughout this paper, we have examined the status and challenges facing species such as the Green Sturgeon and the Atlantic Sturgeon, and the role of organizations like the North American Sturgeon and Paddlefish Society in their conservation. Despite significant efforts, these ancient fish continue to be threatened by a multitude of factors, including habitat loss, pollution, bycatch, and the overarching impacts of climate change.

It is clear that the path to recovery for sturgeon species is a long one, fraught with challenges that demand innovative solutions and strong collaborations among scientists, conservationists, policymakers, and the public. Ongoing research is essential for understanding the needs of sturgeon populations and for developing effective conservation strategies. Public engagement and education are equally important in fostering a sense of stewardship and ensuring that these remarkable species are protected for future generations.

As we look to the future, it is imperative that we maintain and enhance the conservation measures in place, adapting them as necessary to respond to an ever-changing environment. The continued survival of North American sturgeon species is not only crucial for the health of aquatic ecosystems but also for the cultural and economic well-being of human communities. This paper serves as a call to action for all stakeholders to redouble their efforts and work together to secure a future where sturgeon can thrive.
