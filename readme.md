# pantry api
To run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn, you can use the following command:
```bash
cd pantry
```
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

This assumes that your `api.py` file is located in the `pantry` folder and that your Flask app object is named `app`.

# pantry flask ui
```bash
cd Flask
```
```bash
python main.py
```

This assumes that your `main.py` file is located in the `Flask` folder.

Remember to make sure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed and that you are in the correct directory before running these commands.
